Product: PRODIRÂ® PATTERN PEN
Category: Office
Price: $4.5
Description: A fascinating triangular structure characterizes the casing surface of this pen. The pattern is introduced in the injection moulding into the surface of the casing and is an authentic part of the writing instrument. The smooth, minimalistic clip is located above the casing and, in combination with the three-dimensional surface, strongly draws attention to the logo.
